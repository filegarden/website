# Our Ethics

There is only one thing we care about: users. Everything we do must be in service of our non-malicious users. We believe any other underlying goal falls short of bringing about the most overall good to everyone. **If that ever changes, please stop using File Garden.** File Garden should face consequences if it's ever taken in the wrong direction. Publishing an ethics statement like this helps all of you hold us accountable, discouraging us from making bad decisions in the future.

Here are some examples of policies which follow from that goal.

## Sustainability Over Profit

Our users see File Garden as a useful tool, and it should stay that way. Profit is nice, but putting profit first is at odds with usefulness, leading to <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern" target="_blank">dark patterns</A>. We only need profit to remain sustainable, so that this tool can keep being as useful as possible for as long as possible, and permalinks can keep being permanent.

## Never Accept Investors

Businesses that go public or take investor funding are effectively forced to prioritize value to investors, and investors are very often out of touch with what makes users happy. We want our users to drive our business, not investors.

## Require Minimal Trust

All of our code is free and <A href="https://github.com/filegarden/website" target="_blank">open-source</A>, allowing users to verify every detail of File Garden's functionality, both frontend and backend. We use a copyleft license to require the same of anyone who copies our code as well.

## Encourage Competition

Monopolies and <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform" target="_blank">walled gardens</A> (no pun intended) hamper innovation and restrict user freedom. Competitors incentivize each other to improve, making everything better and better for the broader ecosystem over time. This ultimately makes our users happier.

## Don't Ignore Users

Widely hated changes often claim to be the result of user feedback. But where could any real users have participated in said "feedback"? We actively avoid making changes that users dislike by allowing public feedback on each change before the change is made. Currently, this takes place on <A href="/discord" target="_blank">our Discord server</A>.
