# Terms of Service

Your use of any online services provided by us ("Services") is subject to these Terms of Service ("Terms").

"We", "us", or "our" refers to the File Garden organization and its successors and assigns. "You" or "your" refers to any person who has consented to these Terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or not at the time.

## Acceptable Use

You must not use our Services in a manner that violates our Terms or applicable policies, including but not limited to the following:

- Don't violate any laws, regulations, ordinances, or directives.
- Don't do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, tortious, or invasive of another person's privacy.
- Don't do anything in support of malware, phishing, spam, and similar activities.
- Don't interfere with the proper functioning of any of our software, hardware, or equipment.
- Don't engage in any conduct that inhibits anyone else's use or enjoyment of our Services, or which we determine may harm anyone.
- Don't circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, account restrictions, storage space limits, or pricing.
- Don't use our Services in a manner inconsistent with their intended manner or purpose.
- Don't automatically/programmatically upload files that you didn't manually decide to upload. If you need cloud storage for your app (e.g., to handle user-uploaded content), please use a cloud service intended for object storage (such as Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, or Amazon S3).

In our sole discretion, we may at any time change, eliminate, or restrict access to our Services, or modify, suspend, or terminate a user account. If you violate any of our Terms or applicable policies, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and may delete your data. We are not liable for any damages as a result of these actions.

## Your Content

You grant us, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant us, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to store, perform, display, reproduce, distribute, and prepare derivative works of any content you upload to our Services, solely for the purposes necessary to provide our Services. We don't sell your content to third parties, and we don't use your content for advertising purposes. We can disclose your files only in the limited circumstances described in our [Privacy Notice](/privacy).

## Your Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for the development, content, and use of the files you upload to our Services, and you assume all risks associated with them, including intellectual property or other legal claims. Our Services will allow you to share your files with others, which is in your sole control and discretion. We assume no liability for any content that you or anyone else stores with our Services.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our contractors, contributors, licensors, and partners, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services (including, but not limited to, from any content uploaded by you).

## Disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FILE GARDEN AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR CONTENT IS DELETED OR CORRUPTED OR THAT SOMEONE ELSE ACCESSES YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## Limitations of Liability

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, FILE GARDEN AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT AND INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF FILE GARDEN AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH FILE GARDEN. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

## Dispute Resolution

We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against us, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a Notice of Dispute at support@filegarden.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Please include "Notice of Dispute" in the message's subject line. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days after submission, you or we may bring a formal proceeding.

## About These Terms

These Terms will be governed by Michigan law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
