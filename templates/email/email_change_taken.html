<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  If you tried to change your File Garden account's email from
  <a style="font-weight: bold">{{ current_email }}</a> to
  <a style="font-weight: bold">{{ requested_email }}</a>, the email change
  request couldn't be fulfilled because you already have a verified File Garden
  account under that email address.
</p>

<p>If this wasn't you, you can safely ignore this email.</p>

<p>Thanks for using File Garden. :)</p>
